## Website Description:

## Launch Code:


### To Load Book Data
1. Download CSV dataset from [Kaggle Dataset - Goodreads Best Books](https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books/)
  - You only need the `book_data.csv` file, not the images.
  - Download the file to `<repo>/app/dat/book_data.csv`
2. Launch as normal
  - Book data will always be overridden from the CSV file, so if you wish to make modifications to the book data, __delete the CSV file__. (TODO: this structure will likely change.)
